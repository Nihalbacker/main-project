introduction

In the current time, the power plants which uses coal as a fuel has not being much reduced in its count, these industry is responsible of making green house gases like Carbon dioxide (CO2) which leaves carbon footprint (especially carbon dioxide and methane) which causes 1 million premature deaths every year and affects the environment to its bad. This situation leverages the useage of \textbf{Renewable energy sources} especially solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and onshore/offshore wind mills, this would reduce the cost of electricity as well.

Originally designed for local energy systems, advancements in power electronics now allow the integration of large-scale solar and wind farms with main power grids. However, this integration introduces the concept of hosting capacityâ€”how much distributed energy a grid can handle without major upgrades. The uncertainties tied to wind and solar power generation are key factors in determining this hosting capacity.

Accurate forecasting models, utilizing time-series weather data, have become essential for predicting wind and solar power generation. These forecasts are crucial for proper grid operation and control when renewable energy sources are already in place. Moreover, they play a vital role in planning, aiding investment decisions and distribution system planning.

While long-term forecasts have limited use in day-to-day grid operations, precise short-term predictive models are critical for scheduling and grid management. This paper aims to provide a straightforward review of various forecasting models, focusing primarily on short-term forecasts. The review includes an examination of the duration of data used in each model and a practical comparison of their performance.

By shedding light on the strengths and limitations of these forecasting models, this study aims to support informed decision-making in the integration of renewable energy sources into main power grids. The ultimate goal is to ensure a seamless transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.
